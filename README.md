This repository contains codes in Python that allow calculation of various physical quantities for a system consisting of multiple hexagonal lattice layers.
The properties of physical system:
- single species of free spinless fermions,
- layers described by the tight-binding model (Haldane/graphene model),
- layers are AA-stacked.

This code allows to reproduce results of arXiv 1910.05197 (2019)
